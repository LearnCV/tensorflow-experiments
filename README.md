tensorflow-experiments
==========================

I am trying to figure out how much slower tensorflow js is compared to python.
This example trains an LSTM on some house prices data from Zillow.

## Run in node
```
npm install
npm start
```

## Run in the browser
```
npm install
npm run local
```

Navigate to `localhost:8080`, and press the "Train" button. Timings are logged
to the console.
